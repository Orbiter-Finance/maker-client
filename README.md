## Using static files

If you have any files that you want to copy over to the app directory after installation, you will need to add those files in your `src/main/static` directory.

#### Referencing static files from your main process

```ts
/* Assumes src/main/static/myFile.txt exists */

import {app} from 'electron';
import {join} from 'path';
import {readFileSync} from 'fs';

const path = join(app.getAppPath(), 'static', 'myFile.txt');
const buffer = readFileSync(path);
```
